# Stylometry: Keystroke Dynamics Classification

Identify users based on their keystroke dynamics using a deep Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-LSTM).

See our [report](report.pdf) and [Jupyter Notebook](notebook/train.ipynb) for more details.

The website for data collection and inference is deployed live at https://stylometry.pages.dev.
